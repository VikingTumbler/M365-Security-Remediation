## Security Score: {{ "%.0f"|format(score.overall_score) }}/100 — {{ score.risk_rating }}

{% if score.overall_score >= 80 %}
The tenant security posture is **strong**. Continue maintaining current controls while addressing the targeted recommendations below.
{% elif score.overall_score >= 65 %}
The tenant security posture is **adequate but has notable gaps**. Priority remediation of critical and high findings is recommended within 30 days.
{% elif score.overall_score >= 50 %}
The tenant security posture is **concerning**. Multiple high-risk gaps exist that require immediate attention. A remediation sprint is recommended within 14 days.
{% else %}
The tenant security posture is **critically deficient**. Immediate executive engagement and emergency remediation are required. Consider engaging incident response resources proactively.

## Recommended Action Timeline

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
{% if score.critical_findings > 0 %}
| **Immediate (0-7 days)** | Address all critical findings |
{% endif %}
{% if score.high_findings > 0 %}
| **Short-term (7-30 days)** | Remediate high-severity findings |
{% endif %}
| **Medium-term (30-90 days)** | Improve domain maturity levels to 3+ |
| **Ongoing** | Quarterly re-scan and continuous monitoring |
